Running The code
==========================
-The code is writtent in python programming and its machile learning libraries such as numy, pandas, sklearn etc..
-to make the code run appropriatel please download python from the following link:
	https://python.org -official python library website. - download python 3.9+
	-install the python binary on your windows/linux/mac machine

		-run "python -m pip install numpy" -to install numpy
		-run "python -m pip install jupyter" - to install jupyter notebook
		-run "python -m pip install -U scikit-learn" to install sklearn libraries
		-run "python -m pip install openpyxl" to install openpyxl library to read your excel files using pandas

--after doing the installations, using your commandprompt/shell or terminal, navigate to your cloned folder using
the cd command, then run the command "jupyter notebook". The jupyter notebook should launch with an URL which you will
paste on your browser and there you will see a list of files.
click on the jupiternotebbok file named : "app_model_ml_code.ipynb" the run the code.
